Or also for the ones who believes that they can't cook but reality is you can! with CIP.

It’s a step by step cooking app but what makes it unique is the way that it uses the rewarding system just like Duolingo does. It uses the power of ‘’streaks’’ and power it comes with that. ‘The more you cook, the more streaks and rewards you get’
